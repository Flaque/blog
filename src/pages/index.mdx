# hi and welcome to my terrible website

Please enjoy your stay.

I'm a founder of [Room Service](https://www.roomservice.dev/), a cool company about making friends and working together. Awhile ago, I made [Quirk](https://github.com/flaque/quirk), an open source Cognitive Behavioral Therapy app/company. Before that, I worked on [Segment](http://segment.com/)'s developer center.
